        The term “soft skills” is a common buzzword that employers and upper
        management often use when it comes to enhancing workplace efficiency and
        hiring new job candidates. But what does it really mean? People aren’t
        naturally born with good communication and time management skills. These
        are soft skills that need to be developed and worked on over time. The
        Learning Needs provides exhaustive online and in-person soft skills
        training to help develop a positive and productive work culture.
